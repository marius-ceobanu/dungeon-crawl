<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an exciting multiplayer strategy game for all Pokemon fans out there, and a way for them to directly interact online.

Here's why:
* Poke Battlez is the place where you can meet online and chat as a group.
* You can send PMs to any other user, for those private thoughts or invitations for direct challenges.
* You can use all your Pokemon skills and knowledge in configuring and modifying your own team of pokemons, up to 6 of them.
* You can challenge any other user for a 1 to 1 battle.
* You can execute a battle where you can test your customized team together with your best Pokemon battle strategies.

Of course, all Pokemon are available to you, together with a comprehensive list of characteristics you can customize, thanks to the Pokemon API used, more details in acknowledgements

[![register-png][register-png]]()
[![login-png][login-png]]()
[![login-gif][login-gif]]()

* Here all users join a common "room", where they can check who is online, and they can chat, either on  the main chat, or send PM to specific users.

[![chat-png][chat-png]]()

* Click on any user and see the private actions you can take towards that specific user.

[![PM-gif][PM-gif]]()

* Using the button in the header, you open the TEAM configuration modal, where you can configure all your Pokemon slots, with actual characters and with detailed criteria as seen bellow:

[![team-gif][team-gif]]()

* Select the user you want to engage into battle and by pressing the challenge button, you will be transferred on a private room with him/her, where you can chat or execute the battle.

[![challenge-gif][challenge-gif]]()
[![battle-gif][battle-gif]]()

### Battle
* The battle is turn based, with the player being able to select the Pokemon, and the move which to be executed against the adversary Pokemon. Once both players "locked" their own moves, they will get a log response with the results of the turn, and impacting their Pokemon health accordingly. You can also swith between your Pokemon team at any time.
